1) clone the repository

2) Install the dependencies, make sure you are on the right directory
    npm install 

3) on your local machine, start the server on the terminal, make sure you are on the right directory
    npm start 

4) You will need to also run the webpack-dev-server, open another terminal, make sure you are on the right directory
    npm run dev:client

5)  the server listens to port 3000, open your browser
    http://localhost:3000/

6) Upload first the listings.csv and then the contacts.csv
